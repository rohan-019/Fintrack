## Overview

Fintrack is an intuitive and comprehensive open-source financial tracking and insights application designed to provide unparalleled clarity into your financial health, empower strategic decision-making, and foster financial literacy.

The modern financial landscape can be complex and overwhelming. Individuals and businesses often struggle with fragmented data, lack of real-time insights, and an inability to accurately project future financial positions. This leads to missed opportunities, poor resource allocation, and a constant state of reactive management, hindering sustainable growth and peace of mind.

Fintrack provides an elegant solution by centralizing your financial data, offering dynamic visualizations, and delivering actionable insights through advanced metrics. It transforms raw numbers into a clear, compelling narrative of your financial journey, enabling proactive management and informed strategic planning.

### Architecture Overview

This project is primarily a modern web application built on the React framework, powered by Vite for a fast and efficient development experience. It leverages TypeScript for robust type safety and Tailwind CSS for a streamlined, utility-first styling approach. For its backend services, including data persistence, authentication, and potentially real-time capabilities, Fintrack integrates seamlessly with Firebase, adopting a serverless-first architectural pattern that allows for scalability and simplified infrastructure management. The application's structure suggests a strong emphasis on component-based development, context-driven state management, and clear separation of concerns, providing a highly maintainable and extensible codebase.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of Fintrack up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: v18.x or higher (LTS recommended)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **Yarn** or **pnpm**: Comes bundled with Node.js

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fintrack.git
   cd fintrack
   ```
   
   > **Note:** Replace `your-username/fintrack.git` with the actual repository URL

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Using Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   Using pnpm:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase (Optional but Recommended):**

   Fintrack uses Firebase for backend services. To enable full functionality:

   - Create a new project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Set up a Web App within your Firebase project
   - Copy your Firebase configuration (API Key, Project ID, etc.)
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add your Firebase credentials:

   ```env
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN"
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET"
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_APP_ID"
   VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID="YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
   ```

   > Refer to the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs) for setting up Firestore database rules or authentication methods if needed for specific features.

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed and Firebase is configured (if applicable), you can run the application in development mode:

**To start the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

This will typically start the application on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use). Open your web browser and navigate to this URL to access Fintrack.

**For seeding initial transaction data (useful for development and testing):**

```bash
node scripts/seed-transactions.js
```

> **Note:** Ensure your Firebase setup (especially Firestore) is ready to accept data from this script.
